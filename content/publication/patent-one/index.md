abstract: A solution to the problem of computing a continuous stream of motion that is adequate for expressive behaviour of 3D hyper realistic digital human, including social and communicative gestural performance. Advantageously, the resulting animation looks natural, and matches and may be synchronized with the spoken content to be delivered, without requiring a data-based approach or extensive labelling or training of an ML model.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
