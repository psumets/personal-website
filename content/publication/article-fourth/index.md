abstract: The model of a medium, with a glance to its microstructure, is reviewed in this work. Accounting of the characteristic dimension of the medium in the main equations is fulfilled through specifying the strain velocity tensor. A model demonstrating liquid flow in a cylindrical pipe has been built. Dependencies describing distribution of the velocity in the pipe cross section have been presented. The rate of fluid flow, with a glance to the microstructure's influence, has been calculated.
