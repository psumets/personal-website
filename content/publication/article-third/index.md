abstract: It is examined a mathematical model illustrating propagation of a pulse wave with biological activity of a blood vessel’s walls. The influence of the biological factor was allowed for in the equations connecting stresses and deformations of the vessel’s walls among themselves. A formula defining the pulse wave propagation velocity in an orthotropic resilient blood-filled vessel influenced by the biological factor has been deduced. The obtained results allow us to make a conclusion that stimulation of muscle fibers of the vessel’s wall brings on an increase in the pulse wave propagation velocity.
