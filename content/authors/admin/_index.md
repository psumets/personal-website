I am a software engineer, researcher and scientist with a passion for technologies that bring value. By exploring different tech realms, I have established myself as an expert in artificial intelligence, systems architecture, and software development. I'm all about using the latest tech to solve problems with a creative twist. My experience includes working in academia as a lecturer and scientist, researching and developing new technologies for use in commercial production, coding and writing software tools and systems for deep-tech companies. Having a background in applied mathematics, I love using math and systematic approaches to make software and systems work better and smarter. 

The most recent and fascinating journey I have experienced is working at a startup company to create AI-driven autonomous digital people with real-time interaction. My job was developing a technology stack to drive real-time 3D animation, modelling digital agent behavior and understanding user intents and emotional states. It was an invaluable experience that required the ability to connect arts and deep tech, communicate with artists, social scientists, software engineers and a product team to bring it to life. Imagination and creativity were materialized in new patented technologies and successful commercial products.
