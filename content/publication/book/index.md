abstract: The book aims to provide a programming framework for coding linear FEM using matrix-based MATLAB® language and Python scripting language. It describes FEM algorithm implementation in the most generic formulation so that it is possible to apply this algorithm to as many application problems as possible. Readers can follow the step-by-step process of developing algorithms with clear explanations of its underlying mathematics and how to put it into MATLAB and Python code. The content is focused on aspects of numerical methods and coding FEM rather than FEM mathematical analysis. Particular attention is paid to an efficient programming style using sparse matrices.
